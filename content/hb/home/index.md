I feel wistful because she sidelined  me.
But also, I am trusting that she return to me.

I start singing.

I'm lying alone with my head on the phone

Thinking of her till it hurts

I know she hurt too but what else can we do?

Tormented and torn apart

I wish I could carry her smile in my heart

For times when my life seems so low

It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring

When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without her

I know her were right, believing for so long

I'm all out of love, what am I without her?

I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

My phone rings. I look at it, hoping it is her.

It wasn't.

Seeing that makes me want to change the song. Streaming rules.

Lovin' her

Was hard 'cause she's beautiful

And lovin' her

Was all I wanna do

Lovin' her

Was more than just a dream come true

And everything that I do

Was out of lovin' her

I wanna know why I feel like this. I feel strange.
My brain and my body really notice it, on a subconscious level. My cortisol levels go way up. They're sort of like, "Where's my mate? Where's this person who I'm used to regulating with? Something's wrong." These alarm systems go off in my body, because my nervous system suddenly feels like it's under threat because you're alone. Humans are such social animals ... that when I'm alone — in a deeply evolved sense — I don't feel safe. I know that to be alone in the jungle means I'm more likely to face a predator. I're more likely to get injured. Eventually I can get comfortable with [being alone], but when there's a dramatic shift, I do feel on some level unsafe.

Is it an abnormal thing to feel like this though? Where do I go? Well, whatever it is, I think I'll be fine.
