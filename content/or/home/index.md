I feel lucky because she be devoted to me.
But also, I am anticipating that I be devoted to her back.
I start singing.

I'm lying alone with my head on the phone

Thinking of her till it heals

I know she's happy too but what else can we do?

Pleased and still together

I wish I could carry her smile in my heart

For times when my life seems so low

It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring

When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I'm all for love, I'm so happy with her

I know her are right, believing for so long

I'm all for love, what am I without her?

I can't be too early to say that I love her

My phone rings. I look at it, hoping it is her.

It was.

Seeing that makes me want to change the song. Streaming rules.

Lovin' her

Is easy 'cause she's beautiful

And lovin' her

Is all I wanna do

Lovin' her

Is more than just a dream come true

And everything that I do

Is out of lovin' her

I wanna know why I feel like this. I feel strange.

As is well known, falling in love often leads to emotional and physiological instability. I bounce between exhilaration, euphoria, increased energy, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, trembling, a racing heart and accelerated breathing, as well as anxiety, panic and feelings of despair when my relationship suffers even the smallest setback. 

Is it an abnormal thing to feel like this though? Where do I go? Well, whatever it is, I think I'll be fine.
